# This is a facial recognition application written in python in conjunction with opencv library
## The facial detection was done using the HOG method i.e., Histogram of Oriented Gradients
## You will  need to install the module in the requirements.txt using pip for windows and pip3 for linux based systems
### For Linux based Systems
`pip3 install numpy open-cv-python dlib face-recognition cmake`
### For windows based System
`pip install numpy open-cv-python dlib face-recognition cmake`

### After the requirements are installed run the attendance.py (Which is the main program) the main.py was used to set up the system and requirements add your photos slightly to the side and facing camera to the folder and navigate to the root folder of the project and navigate to attendance folder if you are in terminal or cmd and use the commands as below
### For Linux based systems
`python3 attendance.py`
### for Windows based systems
`python attendance.py`
###This was as an assignment given by Dr. Eddy Addero at the end ot the Artificial Intelligence Course to assess our ability to comprehend whatever he had taken us through during the course
